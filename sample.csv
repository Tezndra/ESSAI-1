In order to replicate the groups experiment
"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also
They should take more notes
How much vinager should you pour
In order to replicate this experiment

We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container
Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in
To replicate the experiment
"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass
Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material
First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know
After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data
I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.

Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example
"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
On statement 2
Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.

You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment
In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore
In order to replicate this groups procedure
In order to replicate the experiment
They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome
The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
In order to replicate this experiment
First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room
After reading the groups procedure
The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
You would need the size of the container
In addition to the information given
"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.

To replicate this experiment
"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
In order to replicate the experiment
What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
You would need what semples there
It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
In order to replicate this experiment
We would word correct safety measures to take

You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment
In order to replicate the lab
The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also
Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step
After reading the group's procedure
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of
In the procedure
In order to complete this experiment
To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used
After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
In order to replicate the experiment
They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined
Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so
To replicate this experiment
To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
To replicate the experiment
We had all the information we need to do the experiment
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers
There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1
You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also
In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible
In order to be able to duplicate this experiment
Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because
In order to deplicate this experiment
To repeat this experiment
You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment
The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
In order to replicate this experiment
To replicate the experiment
To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed
"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1
The group needs to add what to label because
First
First
-In step 1
The procedure is not clear
We would need observations during the whole experiment 
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials
1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use
In order to replicate the experiment
In this group's procedure
Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows
I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
After reading the groups procedure
After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample
In order to replicate the experiment
Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well
Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials
You would need more marble
You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in
I don't know what replicate means
First
In the group's procedure
"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate
In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers
In order to replicate this experiment 
They would have to add put each four different sample
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off
Tools.
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples

Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass
In order to replicate this experiment
The group would need to put in the materials
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.

I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples
Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is
You need limestone and marble.
The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials
Determine the ending mass
The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials
The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made
You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally
To replicate the experiment
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment
In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used
Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly
The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample
Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it
There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also
Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container
what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment
1. Firstly
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information
In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers
The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment
You would need to add observations
The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
In order to replicate this experiment
In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble
There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment
"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
After reading this group's procedure
The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment
I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht
The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly
The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar
To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use
If trying to replicate this experiment
In order to replicate this experiment
The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample
Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers
In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used
To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container
To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container
This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly
1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
They did not tell us what to measure with
In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container
Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
To replicate this experiment
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
First they should list the samples they used. Marble
in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
To add to the experiment design
Additials information that would be good to now is
To replicate this experiment
You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass
In order to replicate the group's experement
The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly
The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble
To replicate the experiment 
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
In order to replicate this experiment
To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate
The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore
To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is
To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container
Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup
This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution
"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are
They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them
If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were
To replicate this experiment
In order to replicate this experiment
How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
To make this procedure repeatable
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example
After reading the groups procedure
I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change
After reading the groups procedure
More information is needed
3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container
I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment
In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers
The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone
How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
In the procedure
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in
The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be
Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar
In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also
In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example
The additional information it would need would be the
To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water
Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar
In order to replicate this expiriment
To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were
To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter
After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples
To replicate the experiment
After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure
To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
In order to replicate this procedures
In order to replicate this experiment
Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks
In order to replicate the experiment after reading
Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers
Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time
In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did
In order for you to replicate the experiment
In this procedure the group calls the materials samples
After you determine the mass of the products
In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain
The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be
Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
To replicate the experiment
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also
I would need to know
More you could repete the expierement just see it.
First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
The limestone have mass than all of them.
You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar
In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally
To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use
This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
Some additional information thats needed in this experiment
In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly
To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers
To replicate the experiment
Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container
The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
After reading the procedure
additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container
For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use
You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass
In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control
The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in
A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also
Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted
You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
The additional info I would need to replicate it is
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
In order to replicate this group's procedure
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
In order to replicate
The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar
In order to replicate the group's experiment
In order to do this experiment again
Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table
In order to replicate the experiment
In order to repeat the experiment
You would need a control to look back on
What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work
If there is a control they would need to identify it
Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also
You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
After reading the groups procedure
In order to replicate this experiment
I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
After reading the group's procedure
First off
In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also
First
In order to replicate this experiment
There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First
"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
In order to replicate this experiment
In order to replicate the experiment 
Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers
If I has to replicate the expinment
This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment
After reading this procedure
One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A
In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers
To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
In order to replicate this experiment
After reading the groups procedure
The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples
In order to replicate this experiment
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First
To replicate this experiment I would also need to know
After reading the group's procedure
To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly
"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
To repeat the experiment
Just based off of the procedure
Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information
After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all
You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material
In order to replicate this experiment
Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words
To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example
In order to deplicate this experiment
One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar
To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
What they missed was the samples that they were pouring
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass
One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example
Pour vinegar in each of four separate
You would need: Starting mass
To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also
NSR
In order to replicate the experiment
How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp
You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups
You would need to know how much vinegar to use
To replicate this experiment the following information is needed
In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were
After reading the groups procedure
Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally
The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble
1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
